# Madelbrot Set Visualization
The Mandelbrot Set is... something much better explained by a video by a professional, but basically there's an algorithm that computes if a complex number (with a real part and an imaginary part) satisfies a certain condition. The real component is on the X axis and the imaginary component is on the Y axis. Each pixel at a given zoom level represents a point that can be plugged into the algorithm. The algorithm iterates until either a limit is reach or the condition is satisfied. If the condition is satisfied, the point (pixel) is assigned as being inside the Set and is shaded black. Otherwise, there's modulo arithmetic to assign a hue based on the number of iterations that took place (this is how the rainbow pattern repeats infinitely) representing how close a point is to being inside the Set.
